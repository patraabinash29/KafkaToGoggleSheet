Aiven Kafka GCS Connector
Pull Request Workflow

This is a sink Kafka Connect connector that stores Kafka messages in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

The connector requires Java 11 or newer for development and production.

How It Works
The connector subscribes to the specified Kafka topics and collects messages coming in them and periodically dumps the collected data to the specified bucket in GCS.

Sometimes—for example, on reprocessing of some data—the connector will overwrite files that are already in the bucket. You need to ensure the bucket doesn't have a retention policy that prohibits overwriting.

The following object permissions must be enabled in the bucket:

storage.objects.create;
storage.objects.delete (needed for overwriting).
File name format
The connector uses the following format for output files (blobs): <prefix><filename>.

<prefix> is the optional prefix that can be used, for example, for subdirectories in the bucket.

<filename> is the file name. The connector has the configurable template for file names. It supports placeholders with variable names: {{ variable_name }}. Currently supported variables are:

topic - the Kafka topic;
partition - the Kafka partition;
start_offset:padding=true|false - the Kafka offset of the first record in the file, if padding sets to true will set leading zeroes for offset, default is false;
timestamp:unit=yyyy|MM|dd|HH - the timestamp of when the Kafka record has been processed by the connector.
unit parameter values:
yyyy - year, e.g. 2020 (please note that YYYY is deprecated and is interpreted as yyyy)
MM - month, e.g. 03
dd - day, e.g. 01
HH - hour, e.g. 24
key - the Kafka key.
To add zero padding to Kafka offsets, you need to add additional parameter padding in the start_offset variable, which value can be true or false (the default). For example: {{topic}}-{{partition}}-{{start_offset:padding=true}}.gz will produce file names like mytopic-1-00000000000000000001.gz.

To add formatted timestamps, use timestamp variable.
For example: {{topic}}-{{partition}}-{{start_offset}}-{{timestamp:unit=yyyy}}{{timestamp:unit=MM}}{{timestamp:unit=dd}}.gz will produce file names like mytopic-2-1-20200301.gz.

To configure the time zone for the timestamp variable, use file.name.timestamp.timezone property. Please see the description of properties in the "Configuration" section.

Only the certain combinations of variables and parameters are allowed in the file name template (however, variables in a template can be in any order). Each combination determines the mode of record grouping the connector will use. Currently supported combinations of variables and the corresponding record grouping modes are:

topic, partition, start_offset, and timestamp - grouping by the topic, partition, and timestamp;
key - grouping by the key.
If the file name template is not specified, the default value is {{topic}}-{{partition}}-{{start_offset}} (+ .gz when compression is enabled).

Record grouping
Incoming records are being grouped until flushed.

Grouping by the topic and partition
In this mode, the connector groups records by the topic and partition. When a file is written, a offset of the first record in it is added to its name.

For example, let's say the template is {{topic}}-part{{partition}}-off{{start_offset}}. If the connector receives records like

topic:topicB partition:0 offset:0
topic:topicA partition:0 offset:0
topic:topicA partition:0 offset:1
topic:topicB partition:0 offset:1
flush
there will be two files topicA-part0-off0 and topicB-part0-off0 with two records in each.

Each flush produces a new set of files. For example:

topic:topicA partition:0 offset:0
topic:topicA partition:0 offset:1
flush
topic:topicA partition:0 offset:2
topic:topicA partition:0 offset:3
flush
In this case, there will be two files topicA-part0-off0 and topicA-part0-off2 with two records in each.

Grouping by the key
In this mode, the connector groups records by the Kafka key. It always puts one record in a file, the latest record that arrived before a flush for each key. Also, it overwrites files if later new records with the same keys arrive.

This mode is good for maintaining the latest values per key as files on GCS.

Let's say the template is k{{key}}. For example, when the following records arrive

key:0 value:0
key:1 value:1
key:0 value:2
key:1 value:3
flush
there will be two files k0 (containing value 2) and k1 (containing value 3).

After a flush, previously written files might be overwritten:

key:0 value:0
key:1 value:1
key:0 value:2
key:1 value:3
flush
key:0 value:4
flush
In this case, there will be two files k0 (containing value 4) and k1 (containing value 3).

The string representation of a key
The connector in this mode uses the following algorithm to create the string representation of a key:

If key is null, the string value is "null" (i.e., string literal null).
If key schema type is STRING, it's used directly.
Otherwise, Java .toString() is applied.
If keys of you records are strings, you may want to use org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter as key.converter.

Warning: Single key in different partitions
The group by key mode primarily targets scenarios where each key appears in one partition only. If the same key appears in multiple partitions the result may be unexpected.

For example:

topic:topicA partition:0 key:x value:aaa
topic:topicA partition:1 key:x value:bbb
flush
file kx may contain aaa or bbb, i.e. the behavior is non-deterministic.

Data format
Output files are text files that contain one record per line (i.e., they're separated by \n).

There are two types of data format available:

[Default] Flat structure, where field values are separated by comma (csv)

Configuration: format.output.type=csv. Also, this is the default if the property is not present in the configuration.

Complex structure, where file is in format of JSON lines. It contains one record per line and each line is a valid JSON object(jsonl)

Configuration: format.output.type=jsonl.

Complex structure, where file is a valid JSON array of record objects.

Configuration: format.output.type=json.

The connector can output the following fields from records into the output: the key, the value, the timestamp, and the offset. (The set of these output fields is configurable.) The field values are separated by comma.

It is possible to control the number of records to be put in a particular output file by setting file.max.records. By default, it is 0, which is interpreted as "unlimited".

CSV Format example
The key and the value—if they're output—are stored as binaries encoded in Base64.

For example, if we output key,value,offset,timestamp, a record line might look like:

a2V5,TG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ=,1232155,1554210895
It is possible to control the encoding of the value field by setting format.output.fields.value.encoding to base64 or none.

If the key, the value or the timestamp is null, an empty string will be output instead:

,,,1554210895
NB!

The key.converter property must be set to org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter or org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter for this data format.

The value.converter property must be set to org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter for this data format.

JSONL Format example
For example, if we output key,value,offset,timestamp, a record line might look like:

{ "key": "k1", "value": "v0", "offset": 1232155, "timestamp":"2020-01-01T00:00:01Z" }
OR

{ "key": "user1", "value": {"name": "John", "address": {"city": "London"}}, "offset": 1232155, "timestamp":"2020-01-01T00:00:01Z" }
It is recommended to use

org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter,
org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter, or
io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter.
as key.converter and/or value.converter to make output files human-readable.

NB!

The value of the format.output.fields.value.encoding property is ignored for this data format.
Value/Key schema will not be presented in output file, even if value.converter.schemas.enable property is true. But, it is still important to set this property correctly, so that connector could read records correctly.
JSON Format example
For example, if we output key,value,offset,timestamp, an output file might look like:

[
{ "key": "k1", "value": "v0", "offset": 1232155, "timestamp":"2020-01-01T00:00:01Z" },
{ "key": "k2", "value": "v1", "offset": 1232156, "timestamp":"2020-01-01T00:00:05Z" }
]
OR

[
{ "key": "user1", "value": {"name": "John", "address": {"city": "London"}}, "offset": 1232155, "timestamp":"2020-01-01T00:00:01Z" }
]
It is recommended to use

org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter,
org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter, or
io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter.
as key.converter and/or value.converter to make output files human-readable.

NB!

The value of the format.output.fields.value.encoding property is ignored for this data format.
Value/Key schema will not be presented in output file, even if value.converter.schemas.enable property is true. But, it is still important to set this property correctly, so that connector could read records correctly.

Development
Integration testing
Integration tests are implemented using JUnit, Gradle and Docker.

To run them, you need:

a GCS bucket with the read-write permissions;
Docker installed.
In order to run the integration tests, execute from the project root directory:

./gradlew clean integrationTest -PtestGcsBucket=test-bucket-name
where PtestGcsBucket is the name of the GCS bucket to use.

The default GCP credentials will be used during the test (see the GCP documentation and the comment in GCP SDK code). This can be overridden either by seting the path to the GCP credentials file or by setting the credentials JSON string explicitly. (See Configuration section for details).

To specify the GCS credentials path, use gcsCredentialsPath property:

./gradlew clean integrationTest -PtestGcsBucket=test-bucket-name \
    -PgcsCredentialsPath=/path/to/credentials.json
To specify the GCS credentials JSON, use gcsCredentialsJson property:

./gradlew clean integrationTest -PtestGcsBucket=test-bucket-name \
    -PgcsCredentialsJson='{type":"...", ...}'
Gralde allows to set properties using environment variables, for example, ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_testGcsBucket=test-bucket-name. See more about the ways to set properties here.
